# Numpy-Home-Exercises

This project demonstrates various manipulations and operations on NumPy arrays, such as creating arrays, modifying elements, and performing array operations. It provides examples and methods that can be used to handle arrays efficiently in Python.

(i wasnt sure exactly if i needed to include a readme file, so i just let chatgpt do the work on this)

## Project Description

This repository contains Python scripts that showcase different functionalities with NumPy arrays. You will learn how to:
- Create NumPy arrays of different shapes and sizes.
- Modify elements of an array.
- Perform basic operations such as finding the size, mean, and sum of elements in an array.
- Append elements to an existing array.

## Installation Instructions

To use the examples in this project, you need to have Python and the NumPy library installed. You can install NumPy using pip:
No need to install random as its already installed in python just import it.
```bash
pip install numpy
